        <div style="font: 15px 'Georgia'">Playing a Card</div>
        <p> If you want to play a card, click and drag the desired card to a players house. If the card is a "Moose in the House," then drag the card to the designated area. </p>

        <br><div style="font: 15px 'Georgia'">Drawing a Card</div>
        <p> When you need to draw a new card, either click and drag, or simply click on the deck located at the bottom right corner of the play area. If the deck is empty, the pass button will appear. </p>

        <br><div style="font: 15px 'Georgia'">Passing</div>
        <p> When the deck is empty, the "Pass" button becomes visible. Clicking this button will skip your turn. When you don't have any playable cards, you must press the "Pass" button. </p>

        <br><div style="font: 15px 'Georgia'">Discard a Card</div>
        <p> If you get a card you do not want, you can drag the card to the discard pile which is located next to the deck. </p> 

        <br><div style="font: 15px 'Georgia'">Moose in the House Cards</div>
        <p> If you recieve the "Moose in the House" card and want to play it, drag the card to the designated labled area for a chosen player's house. </p>

        <br><div style="font: 15px 'Georgia'">Special Cards</div> 
        <p> If you recieve a "Trap" or "Door" card, it can be played just like any other regular card: by clicking and dragging it to the appropriate playing card area.
            NOTE: "Trap" cards may only be played immediately after a Moose has been played.</p>
