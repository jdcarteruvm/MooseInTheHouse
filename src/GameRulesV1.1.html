        <h1 style="color:#9D344B; font: 23px 'Georgia'">Rules of Play</h1>
        
        <div style="font: 23px 'Georgia'">Content</div>
        <p>20 Empty Room cards (5 each of Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Room
and Bedroom)<br>
20 Moose in the Room cards (same as above, but with Moose)<br>
10 There’s a Moose in the House cards<br>
5 Door cards<br>
3 Moose Trap cards</p>
        
        <div style="font: 23px 'Georgia'">Object</div>
        <p>The object of the game is to keep moose out of the rooms of your
        house, put moose into your opponents’ houses, and have the fewest
        moose in your house when the last card is played.</p>
        
        <div style="font: 23px 'Georgia'">Setup</div>
        <p>The first time you play, look through the deck to get familiar with
the cards. Note that each Empty Room card has a matching colorcoded
Moose in the Room card.</p>
        <p>Choose a player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck, deals
four cards to each player, and places the remaining cards in a face
down draw pile in the center of the playing area. Players look at
their cards but keep them secret from opponents.</p>
        
        <div style="font: 23px 'Georgia'">How to Play</div>
        <p>All players start the game with an invisible empty “house” in front
of them on the playing surface. As the game progresses, players fill
opponents’ houses with rooms and then their rooms with moose.</p>
        <p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues
clockwise. Start each turn by drawing one card from the face down
deck. Then take ONE of the following actions:<br>
1) Play a There’s a Moose in the House card on any opponent that
doesn’t already have one.<br>
2) Play an empty room card on any opponent that has less than
three empty rooms.<br>
3) Play a matching Moose in the Room card on top of any opponent’s
empty room (providing they have a There’s a Moose in the House
card in front of them).<br>
4) Play a Door card on one of your empty rooms.</p>
        <p>If you can’t play any of your cards, simply discard one into a face
up pile next to the draw pile. This ends your turn, and play moves
to the next player.</p>

        <div style="display:block;text-align:left;font: italic 23px 'Times New Roman'">
            <img align="left" src="../resources/images/30dpi/moose-in-the-house.png" border="0" width="70" height="100">There's a Moose in the House</div>
        <p>This is a very important card early in the game, as you
cannot put any moose into opponents’ houses until they have one
of these in front of them. To play this card, place it face up in front of any opponent and announce, “There’s a Moose in Your House!”
Once you get a There’s a Moose in the House card, it stays for the
duration of the game. You can’t stop anyone from giving one to you
and you can’t get rid of it. However, each player may only get one
There’s a Moose in the House card during the game.</p>
        <p>Notes: Once all players have a There’s a Moose in the House card
in front of them, discard any extra There’s a Moose in the House
cards from your hand, and draw new cards to bring it back up to
four. Also, if you draw a There’s Moose in the House card after all
players have a There’s a Moose in the House card in front of them,
simply discard it and draw another card.</p>

        <div style="display:block;text-align:left;font: italic 23px 'Times New Roman'">
            <img align="left" src="../resources/images/30dpi/bed.png" border="0" width="70" height="100">  Empty Rooms</div>
        <p>There are four different empty rooms
in the house: a kitchen, living room,
bedroom and bathroom. During your turn, try to give one of these
cards to another player. If an opponent gives you an Empty Room
card, place it face up in front of you, visible to all. Once you get an
Empty Room card, opponents may play a matching Moose in the
Room card on top of it during subsequent turns, unless you close
it first using a Door card (see below). Empty Room cards are the
only cards you can give opponents before they have a There’s a
Moose in the House card in front of them.</p>
        <p>Notes:
• Build your “house” from left to right in front of you, keeping the
There’s a Moose in the House card on the outside left.<br>
• You can have multiple matching rooms in your house (for example,
two kitchens, three bedrooms, etc.). However, you cannot have
more than three empty rooms (without a Closed Door or Moose)
in your house at once during the game.</p>

            <img align="left" src="../resources/images/30dpi/bed-moose.png" border="0" width="70" height="100">Moose in the Rooms</div>
        <p>Each empty room has a matching
Moose in the Room card. Once
opponents have a There’s a Moose in the House card, you can put
moose in their rooms. Look at the Empty Room cards in front of
your opponents. If someone has an Empty Room card that matches
a Moose in the Room card from your hand, place the card face up
on top of the Empty Room card and announce, “There’s a Moose in
your [name of room]!” Moose in the Room cards are counted at the
end of the game.</p>
        <p>Notes: You may only play Moose in the Room cards on
opponents who have a There’s a Moose in the House Card in front
of them. Also, you can only play one Moose in the Room card per
Empty Room.</p>

        <div style="display:block;text-align:left;font: italic 23px 'Times New Roman'">
            <img align="left" src="../resources/images/30dpi/door.png" border="0" width="70" height="100">Door</div>
        <p>Door cards keep moose out of the rooms in your house.
Play a Door card face up on top of any Empty Room card in front
of you. When you do, say “Slam!” Doors permanently shut rooms
and stay in place until the end of the game.</p>
        <p>Note: This is the only card that you may play to your house and
you may only play it on an empty room.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <div style="display:block;text-align:left;font: italic 23px 'Times New Roman'">
            <img align="left" src="../resources/images/30dpi/trap.png" border="0" width="70" height="100">Moose Trap</div>
        <p>Use a Moose Trap card to get rid of pesky moose! When
someone tries to put a moose in one of your empty rooms, play this
card immediately from your hand. Show the card to your opponent
and say “Moose Trap!” Take both the Moose Trap card along with
the opponent’s Moose in the Room card and place them in the
discard pile. (Leave your Empty Room card as players may still try
to put another moose there later in the game.) Then, draw another
card to bring your hand back up to four cards. Play continues as
usual with the player to the left of the person who tried to put a
moose in your house.</p>
        <p>Note: You can only play this card as an instant action during
someone else’s turn, not during your turn.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <div style="font: 23px 'Georgia'; color: #9D344B">Ending the Game</div>
        <p>When the last card is drawn from the deck, continue playing out
the cards in your hand. Take turns as usual, playing one card at a
time. If you can’t play a card from your hand, say “pass.” Keep going
until all players are either out of cards or cannot move (have to
pass). At this point, add the total number of Moose in the Room
cards, both in your hand and in your house. The player with the
fewest Moose wins. (In the case of a tie, the player with the most
closed doors wins.)</p>
