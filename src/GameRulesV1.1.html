        <head>2-4 players; Age 8 & up. A very silly Card Game</head>
        <h1>Rules of Play</h1>
        
        <div>Content</div>
        <p>20 Empty Room cards (5 each of Kitchen, Bathroom, Living Room
and Bedroom)<br>
20 Moose in the Room cards (same as above, but with Moose)<br>
10 There’s a Moose in the House cards<br>
5 Door cards<br>
3 Moose Trap cards</p>
        <hr>
        
        <div>Object</div>
        <p>The object of the game is to keep moose out of the rooms of your
        house, put moose into your opponents’ houses, and have the fewest
        moose in your house when the last card is played.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <div>Setup</div>
        <p>The first time you play, look through the deck to get familiar with
the cards. Note that each Empty Room card has a matching colorcoded
Moose in the Room card.</p>
        <p>Choose a player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck, deals
four cards to each player, and places the remaining cards in a face
down draw pile in the center of the playing area. Players look at
their cards but keep them secret from opponents.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <div>How to Play</div>
        <p>All players start the game with an invisible empty “house” in front
of them on the playing surface. As the game progresses, players fill
opponents’ houses with rooms and then their rooms with moose.</p>
        <p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues
clockwise. Start each turn by drawing one card from the face down
deck. Then take ONE of the following actions:<br>
1) Play a There’s a Moose in the House card on any opponent that
doesn’t already have one.<br>
2) Play an empty room card on any opponent that has less than
three empty rooms.<br>
3) Play a matching Moose in the Room card on top of any opponent’s
empty room (providing they have a There’s a Moose in the House
card in front of them).<br>
4) Play a Door card on one of your empty rooms.</p>
        <p>If you can’t play any of your cards, simply discard one into a face
up pile next to the draw pile. This ends your turn, and play moves
to the next player.</p>
