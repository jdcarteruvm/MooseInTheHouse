3/19: Initial files: Everything in the parent directory is stuff from the first deliverable. Handy for reference, I guess. Some of the graphics will likely be useful as well.

3/19: I added image files for all the cards in the resources folder. They're huge - 300dpi! But that allows us to resize them as we wish when we figure out how big the cards will be in the GUI.

We should probably consider keeping this file up to date so we have good notes of development progress when it comes time to write up our different deliverables.

3/26: (Joey) Added class files for MITH_Card and MITH_Deck, each with initial methods and constructors working properly. 

3/28: (Joey) Added class file for MITH_Hand, with constructor and initial methods addCard() and removeCard() working properly. Class MITH_Deck needs reset().
